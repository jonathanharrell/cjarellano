                    <p>I shot a test video with John Cates and Kate James for a corporate project. Reviewing the footage, I was tickled by their natural comic chemistry, and I wanted to write something that showcased their rapport. After envisioning them as a married couple beset by telepathic powers, I drew up the script for “Mind Over Marriage.”</p>
                    <p>Conceived as something that could work as a stand-alone story and a series pilot, “Mind Over Marriage” was shot over a period of four days, buoyed by the assured cinematography of Adam Orton. It was during this project where I learned one of my most cherished rules of directing: when you hire talented actors who appreciate the needs of the story and characters, it's often best to call “Action!” and just get out of the way.</p>
